<P><h4>Chapter 1</h4>


Twenty minutes past midnight, while writing a what-if scenario, I found myself lying in wet mud. Then, I quickly got up and surveyed my surroundings. I found myself beside junk piles.

The air smelt sour and heavy with mist, and then I saw a person with blue hair on the other side of the riverbed. I saw only her backside, but that was enough for me to realise she was Jinx.

I was in shock. I was in the world of Arcane, or, in other words, Runeterra. By the time I composed myself, she was already gone.

Then, I noticed a yellow dot in my peripheral vision. When I focused on it, a message window popped up that read, "Congratulations on becoming a universal traveller. I am the System that will help you throughout your Journeys and issue missions so that you can enjoy your Travels." Seeing that, I relaxed. Finally, it had a working system. Though I had amassed quite a lot of power in my previous travels, a system makes things much more manageable.

Just then, the System issued a mission, "Possess the body of a dead native, reward smartphone with Limited internet connectivity. Failure will mean death as the new universe doesn't suit the traveller's body."

Then, a five-minute countdown began. Using transfiguration, I quickly turned into a bat and dove into the river. I kept diving deeper and deeper to find Silco's body, which was about 8 meters deep. When I finally found the body, two eels about a meter long circled it. I hypnotised them to leave.

Then I got under the body and pushed it upwards.

I reached the shore with 3 minutes on the countdown left. Taking a few breaths to calm myself, I told the System to begin the possession. It took about 15 seconds to complete the task. The process left a bat-shaped mark on Silco's back. "Congrats on completing the mission. Your reward can be found in the inventory as the possessed body is malnourished and affected by shimmer. It will undergo a mutation, so there will be some side effects such as, Transformation will be turned into Cloak, Mystic-web will be turned into Organic-web, and Foresight will be turned into Spider-sense etc."

Following that, I cloaked myself and headed toward the Undercity. Along the way, I remembered various memories of my past lifetimes, some good, some horrible, and some weird. Then, I tried remembering the show's events.

Right then, a message popped up. " Because of the current body's mutations, some powers may need to be sacrificed or transferred to maintain body stability. I asked the System How long the mutation would take.

The System replied, "Seven months. Around the time of the seventh episode or the third act. "Can I fasten the process?"

A new mission popped up, "Become the shadow leader of the Undercity. Reward-potion to unlock 10% mana."

'Better than before, I guess.' 'Sorry to disappoint,' The System said with some sass. I quickly comforted her and told her she didn't have to be disappointed.

"I am glad that you are here to help me."

After that, when I reached the city, I searched Silco's memories for a place to lay low and set up a base. There was a secret place underground of the old ruined shimmer factories.

But before going to the base, I bought myself a mask and a hooded cloak, both of which had a black-and-white colour scheme. I also got some stationery items like pencils, paint, paper, diaries, and a standard map of the Undercity. 'Oh no! I forgot to buy groceries. So I went back to buy them.'

To be continued.</P>





<P><h4>Chapter 2</h4>




Even though I have 35 years and 3 lifetime's worth of experience, I still make silly mistakes.

For example, as I was buying some bread today, the shopkeeper kept looking at me as if I were a ghost. As I felt a gust of wind on my face, I remembered that I hadn't put on my mask. The System kindly reminded me, "The host is about to lose his cover."

I quickly covered my face with my left hand and hypnotised the shopkeeper to forget the last five minutes. I felt a bit embarrassed. When was the last time I felt that way?

I contemplated which aspects of the show I wanted to change or intervene in. Then, I laid out my plans to become a Shadow Lord. The quickest way to achieve that goal was to unite the chem-barons. But how could I do that? The System then asked, "Would the host like a quest?" I declined the offer but felt compelled to review my abilities."

- Superior Immunity etc

Just as I read Vampirification's description, I leapt up in excitement.

Description: It turns various beings into subordinate vampire kins or admiring dhampirs.

I was so excited that I did not wait to start my schemes. In the dead of night, I kidnapped Chross and Margot and turned them into my subordinate kins. However, due to my mutation, they did not gain any special A+-grade abilities. They had basic vampiric features like pale skin, pointy ears, fangs, and blood-red pupils. They also gained 3.5 times their lifespan and 2 times their strength, stamina, and dexterity.

Species-specific abilities- night vision and echolocation.

Using psychic sorcery and hypnosis, I changed their personalities to be generous, loyal, and patient. The plan was going so well that, in my happiness, I gave them a pair of special antique couple rings.

Those rings are unique because they make their wearers think and care for each other. They also have tracking and health information-sharing capabilities.

They were essentially a married couple without an official registry. Then I told them to gather their henchmen in a secret area so that I could turn them into dhampirs.

<P><h4>Chapter 3</h4>




The night skies of Runeterra were just beautiful. In my original world, the Sky never looked so magical, probably because that world did not have any magic. After some stargazing, I decided to roam the Undercity as I did not feel sleepy. Even though the city was in dire straits, it was filled with people of all colours, ethnicities, and other humanoid species. Its diversity could rival that of the world of Yonderseth.

The houses, stores, and factories were very congested. There were many alleys, and each one had a story to tell. I also learned about the common people's living conditions—they were harsh, to say the least.

I wanted to help, especially the children, who were being used as cheap labour. Then I remembered that I had just made subordinates, and they both had huge building complexes.

So, I made a mental note to tell them to set up a few schools, hostels and orphanages.

I also wanted to help the addicts. And stop daylight prostitution and BDSM nightclubs.

Then I got a caution message: "Changing too much of the city may change the main story events, and cosmic beings may notice the host." That thwarted my plans. "What changes can I make? What events are critical?"

Caitlyn and Violet's divergence.

Ambessa's Shadow rules over Piltover through Caitlyn.

Isha leading the riots.

Jinx and Sevika free the rioters.

Ekko, Jayce, and Heimerdinger are transported to different worlds.

They must stop Viktor from converting everyone into his pawns.

Ambessa must be killed before she gains complete control of Piltover.



'So that means I can't interfere until the third act starts….troublesome?'

However, there are too many problems in Zaun, such as the smog, the toxic environment, thugs and gangs exploiting the weak and innocent.

It was similar to Gotham but suffered even more because of its lack of modernisation. As I returned to base, I saw various metal tubings, which gave me an idea to help Zaun from the Shadows.

A few days later, my Kin's henchmen gathered in a vast underground place—about 123 in total. I turned them into my dhampirs.

I told Margot's prostitutes, "You have likely faced many challenges to survive in this city. If any of you wish to leave this line of work, you can find employment in Baron Chross's factories. Your pay will be good, and the workload will be manageable so you won't feel overwhelmed. I assure you of that." After hearing my speech, about 35 out of 63 joined the workforce.

One young woman among them said, "Sir, we don't want to work in factories. That kind of work does not suit us. Can we do something else? (About 13 of them shared the same thoughts)." I told them, "I would like you guys to survey the pipelines all over the city and make a map of them. I have a project in mind." Thus, the prostitution and nightclub problems were managed.

I planned to use the pipelines to clear the smog and purify the air with the air purifiers I had discovered in my previous world, Giea. Although I needed a significant amount of electricity to operate the purifiers, that was not an issue because I could easily generate it.

Thought of using wind generators. But it was not a good idea as they would garner too much attention. Then, I thought solar panels were a better option.

Both options would take a lot of time and effort, but I had a lot of free time and manpower.

If I needed more manpower, I could make more Minions…..Oh, and Smeech is Going to die soon. I could take his goons, too.

On that note, I recalled that if I succeeded in resurrecting the councillors, I could gain the favour of Piltover and provide benefits to Zaun.

Then, I left for my base. Upon reaching it, I remembered I needed the councillors' dead bodies. Thankfully, I knew Mrs Kiramman's resting place. However, I could not revive her right now because that would interfere with the current events, so as a second option, I decided to go to the central graveyard in Piltover to retrieve her soul.

I reached the graveyard, found her grave and dug up her corpse. Using her corpse as a spirit medium, I performed a ritual to call upon her soul.

After finding her soul, I used my Soul Flux to capture it. I also captured Silco's soul so I would not forget about it later. I noticed that his soul had decayed by about 20-25%.

Then, I placed a healing Runestone on Mrs Kiramman's body that stopped decomposition and removed traces of my actions. After that, I returned home. The following day, while supervising the workers, I found it very difficult to handle everything independently, so I needed some well-experienced scientists to manage them in my stead. As I was thinking of who to hire, I thought of Singed, but I did not know where he was.

There was also the Power Crisis. In the current timeline, this world did have electricity, but it was not used industrially. It was only used in specialised Piltover Labs and some special chemical plants. They mainly used some crude chemical means to produce and store electricity.

So I made some blueprints for solar panels, wind generators, and various other appliances, gave them to Margot to file for patents, and instructed the workers on how to make them. But I kept running into problems. I needed help. I once again tried thinking of where Singed could be. Then, an insidious idea came to me. I knew where his daughter was. She was in his old hideout, in the abandoned Kiramman estate. Therefore, I left to find that place. It was easy as I had Tia Dalma's compass.

<P><h4>Chapter 4</h4>




On the 17th day of the first month of the year, on my way to the abandoned Kiramman estate, I hypnotised a few civilians to become deep-cover agents to monitor the Noxus soldiers.

After searching and questioning the locals, I found the doctor's lab. As I entered the lab, I found various organs in canisters, scattered documents and lab equipment. I also found Vander's weak & frail body inside a nutrition tube.

Maybe the doctor had gone to retrieve the double-headed wolf's heart.

Then I found the key to her daughter's secret room. Opening the door to Orianna's room was the best thing I ever did. As I lay my eyes on her face, the first thought that came to me was…Pretty…VERY PRETTY.

Now I knew why the doctor went mad over her. I was mesmerised. She had the kind of beauty others wanted to kill for. At least, that was the case for me. I told the System to give me a diagnosis of her body. It said to me that her body was fine, but she was braindead.

The news broke something inside me, and I could not fix her. Her soul is intact, and her body is in good condition. I had no way to save her.

As I was dwelling in despair, the System issued a new mission, "Make Orianna Reveck your blood-bound bride. Reward unlocks 15% of Mana. Failure will cause extreme mental instability."

Just as I finished reading the mission, Singed used a poison grenade and a flashbang on me, which caught me off guard because of my mental state. However, I managed to dispel the gas using wind magic.

Then, I subdued my future father-in-law, who tried to kill me. "Doctor, I mean you no harm; I came here to save your daughter." "Don't you dare say you came to save her! You want to use her against me, bastard!" "Well, that's partially true. I want your services, but I also want to save her because I am..(in love with her)," but I left those words unsaid. "Fuck Off!! If you go anywhere near her, I will kill you."

Seeing that I could not calm him down, I tied his mouth with a cloth. Then I removed her(Orianna) from the capsule in a princess carry.

I tried but could not move my attention away from her face. It was beauty personified. I couldn't control myself and bit down on her neck to begin the process of making her my blood queen. Her blood tested like honey milk. Like a marooned man in a desert, I started greedily drinking her blood until I felt her petit arms clutching my robe.

I moved away to Look at her face. She was breathing hard. We stared into each other for what felt like an eternity.

But then my future father-in-law broke out of his binds by breaking the chair he was bound to.

The sound broke our stupefied staring contest.

I quickly placed her down, and she stood holding me for support.

The doctor couldn't believe his eyes. "Orianna," he called out. With a blushing face, she replied in a mosquito voice, "Dad, please don't be mad." That call of 'dad' made Singed tearfully hug her for dear life.

Then, I moved away from them to give them some space. When I went back into the lab, to my surprise, I saw Vander hanging by the ceiling with chains.

He was in a very precarious situation, but I could not help him now as he will play a significant role in the future.

However, that did not sit well with me, so I decided to orchestrate an event so that the end would be the same, but the man would survive.

After the father-daughter reunion, I chatted with both of them. Singed reluctantly agreed to work with me. I assigned him to work as my factory supervisor and to continue his lab experiments with Vander.

I also suggested that Orianna continue her studies in the newly refurbished(courtesy of my sponsorship) Zaun College, as I could guarantee her safety there. (I could also talk to her.)

Singed vehemently disagreed, but seeing his daughter's pleading eyes, he could not say 'no'. I mean, seriously, nobody could.

Following that, the next two months were very productive, though a bit dull. We managed to streamline our solar panel production line and now have about 100 60-cell panels. We also made IPS battery systems with improved energy density using Shimmer-carbon-gallium-based chemistry.

These new batteries had five times the storage capacity of lithium-ion batteries and at least twenty times the capacity of existing battery technology. Additionally, we developed various everyday appliances such as induction cookers, air coolers, and LED lights. However, I needed to purchase real estate for new factories and hire an additional 500 workers to produce these items.

<P><h4>Chapter 5</h4>




The Seasons and times are not fickle. They have their own rules, and they follow them without complaining. 
Summer has ended, and the monsoon season has started like clockwork.

Two months and 17 days have passed since I arrived here.

In the meantime, I signed a peace treaty with Sevika, becoming the undisputed leader of Undercity. With the mission complete, I finally had access to 15 % of my Mana.

Using my own Mana was a great feeling rather than relying on artefacts, rituals, and blood sacrifices.

Some significant events took place in the last 2 months. Caitlyn and Violet fell out, Sevika and Jinx killed Smeech the Chem-Baron, and Caitlyn became commander and issued Martial Law. 
Jinx found Isha and rescued her from the thugs. Also, The Three Musketeers (Ekko, Jayce & Heimerdinger) were missing.
All these things happened within a few months. Talk about a packed schedule. Anyway, I supervised and helped Singed sometimes. I went on some night patrols to scare the thugs and gangs. On the patrols, I dressed similarly to Moonknight. The common people called me White Knight. I made a 20-foot-tall statue of Jenna. I also told the people I saved from the thugs that I was Jenna's Apostle.
All of these actions made Jenna favour me, and we became friends. As a reward, the System unlocked 25% of my Mana. However, this newfound power was causing instability in my possessed body. Silco's old, mutating body could not handle the immense amount of Mana I had gained.

Presently, things had settled down. I taught mechanics, mathematics, physical exercise, and martial arts at the college. I enjoyed my time at school because I could see and talk to Orianna. Talking to her, I knew that she was very bright, and our relationship developed nicely. However, we did not take things to the final step. In the beginning, the doctor was displeased with our growing fondness. But now that we have gotten to know each other, we have come to respect one another.

Nowadays, the doctor has stopped taking chemical enhancements, so his mind and body are at ease. 
By the 20th day of the third month, my air purifying System was in place, and the Solar Panels(about 200) were placed above the Undercity on the toxic soil.

I also made all the necessary wind generator parts and the power lines. Still, I did not assemble them as they would garner too much attention. Months went by under martial law. The people of Zaun grew more discontent, and Isha's riot started on the 7th day of the 6th month. Afterwards, I made my move. I instructed the doctor to do as he did in the show. Jinx infiltrated the prison to Rescue Isha and the rioters. Warwick did what he did in the show, but there were no deaths as I used sleeping gas on the prison Guards to incapacitate them. Jinx fought Vander, and after some tussle, he recognised Jinx. After that, they made their escape.

<P><h4>Chapter 6</h4>




At the prison, Ambessa is the first person to wake up. She was Furious.
 
Then she saw the damaged cargo cart. She deduced that this was done by a fierce and powerful beast and brought up the topic with Caitlyn. She suggested that they use this incident as an excuse to invade and control Zaun completely.

However, contrary to the show, she disagreed. She told Ambessa," This incident was very calculated, and whoever did this does not want to escalate things further." "How can you be so sure? They broke out of our most secure prison, CAITLYN. We have to teach them a lesson."

"No, we do not. They could have easily taken a more direct and brute tactic; they could have killed our prison Guards, Taken all the Rifles and staged a coup, but they didn't. This was a warning from them. They want a peaceful resolution to this martial law."

" And you are going to give them that!? Have you forgotten what they did?" "I haven't. I never will, but that does not mean our cities must pay with blood, which is all for one individual's brash choices." Saying that, Caitlyn left for home. Ambessa was livid. 'I saw potential in you. But your usefulness has run its course. She beckoned a Noxus soldier and said, "Relay to Ms Nolan that the commander does not see the light of day."

While that was happening, our hero retrieved the doctor from prison. "Thank you for doing this for me, Doctor." "No need for pleasantries. Just bring me the requested materials." After escorting my future father-in-law home, I went to where Jinx kept Vander to bring him back. I checked the parameters to see if Jinx was still there. She wasn't. I entered the tunnel and made some clapping noise to illuminate the place. After some walking, I was attacked by Warwick. I dodged his attacks and used sleeping to put him to sleep. Then I carried him on my back to the lab. There, I found Singed. I handed him Warwick and the materials he requested. Using them and Warwick's blood, he made the special healing solution from the show (the one he used to revive Orianna). The process only took about 20 minutes because of the advanced lab equipment I provided when we started working together. While waiting, I thought it was about time I orchestrated some events to ensure that Ambessa died, as in the show, and I used my trump card to get Caitlyn on my side.

"About time I reunited the mother-daughter pair." Time for a date night. Before that, I decided to fix Vander. To Do that, I made an intricate magical array on the lab floor. He placed Vander upon it and wrote ancient runic letters on his whole body. As this was a body, mind & soul alteration ritual, copious amounts of blood sacrifice were required. Using the ritual, I entered Vander's mindscape. As much as possible, I separated his intact memories and soul from the bestial parts. Then, I stored the bestial parts in an antique soul guard. Doing that stabilised his mind and made his body lose most of the bestial characteristics. He now had the appearance of a tall, lean half-werewolf.

<P><h4>Chapter 7</h4>




Tonight, there was a full moon, casting its soft silver light across the world. Everything looked different under its glow. The sky was clear, revealing the stunning beauty of countless stars and nebulas in all their glory. I was leaping from rooftop to rooftop in an effort to reach Caitlyn's estate. As I approached her residence, I heard the sounds of glass breaking, grunting, and struggling. With my cloak wrapped around me, I slipped into the room through the window. Inside, I found an injured Caitlyn being choked by Maddie Nolan.

I quickly sprung into action, got the spy enforcer off Caitlyn and snapped her neck.

Caitlyn regained her composure and aimed her rifle at me with her uninjured hand, as her right shoulder had been shot. "Don't move. Who are you?" she demanded.

I faced her and replied, "I am White Knight, the shadow leader of Zaun."

"What are you doing here?" she asked.

"Well, I was hoping we could form a truce and unite our cities against a common enemy," I suggested.

"What enemy?"

Just as she phrased her question, I leveraged my superior speed and reflexes to disarm her and swiftly tied her to the study chair.

She was surprised and disoriented by that interaction. " You really shouldn't be pointing that at me. Anyway, let's get down to business."

Then, I showed her letters and documents about Ambassa's plans for destabilising and annexing Piltover. (gathered by the deep-cover spies in Piltover.)

Caitlyn was furious. She said, "I was just a puppet….. a means to an end." I looked at Miss Nolan's dead body and said,

" I should be thankful to her if she had not attracted you. Convincing you would have taken a lot more work."

Caitlyn also looked at Ms Nolan's corpse, "She(Ambessa) was right about work engagements."

" Anywho, I have a proposal."

"Go on,"

" You give my city recognition, rights, and autonomy. In exchange, I give you your mother back."

"If you dare say one more word about my mother, I swear I will skin you alive and make you regret everything."

Haa…. I signed, " It seems I have to show you to make you believe me."

Afterwards, I princess carried her on my lap and took her to the cemetery. Along the way, she kept biting my neck and jawline.

But I paid her no heed and stayed on course. When I reached the graveyard, I put her down, applied shimmer on her injured shoulder, and bandaged it. I also used a bit of healing magic on her injured area to numb the pain and disinfect it.

Then, I tied her to a nearby tree so she would not run away. I then dug up Mrs Kiramman's corpse and infused it with her soul, which I had retrieved long ago. I also used blood magic to revitalise her body. Then, I unbound Caitlyn and let the mother-daughter pair catch up. Feeling like a third wheel, I left and returned home.

Three days later, a new mission popped up, " Save Viktor and his followers from their tragic fate. Reward: unlock 50% Mana + Potion for stabilising the original body." The mission came about when I went to the underground Hexgate facility. I wanted to see how it worked and study the core power source.

When I reached there, I witnessed Jayce and Salo talking. Well, that was a short talk. Jayce ended his life with his new hammer. Following that, Jayce made his way towards Viktor's village. I followed him there. Things went smoothly. He reached Viktor's round altar and attacked him with his hammer power blast.

After that, I knocked Jayce out. I approached Viktor and told him, "I can save you, Viktor. But I want your loyalty in exchange." "Who are you?" " I am White Knight" " I heard…rumours about…you…What you want…I can give…but you have to…. save them(villagers)…too." Brought out a soul flux and said, "I was going to. Even if you didn't ask." As I was separating his soul from his body, there were two souls, to my surprise. The other soul was Viktor's assistant. After that, I used a massive magic array to turn all the villagers into dhampirs. I did that because of efficiency and because 35% of my Mana was already unlocked when I retrieved ViKtor's soul. However, that was a bad idea as my body became unstable. So I quickly left there, taking Jayce with me.

To be continued.</P>





<P><h4>Chapter 8</h4>




On the 8th day of the 6th month, Caitlyn and Ambessa had a falling out in the council meeting regarding the relevant evidence. Ambessa gave Piltover two days to decide whether to resist or surrender. On the 9th day, Mel Medarda returned. After hearing Mel's prophecy about Ambessa, the councillors made the tough decision to resist. On the 10th day, at noon, the Noxon Battleships docked, and the battle commenced.

Around the same time, Violet and Jinx searched for Vander in the Undercity. Jinx searched the lines, and Vi searched the factories. As I was jumping off my factory roof, my body suddenly convulsed violently, and I dropped Jayce atop Vi. The System reminded me,

" Danger, problem assimilating power into mutated body. The host has to transfer some powers and abilities to others right now."

My body was in agony. In my peripheral vision, I saw Vi & Jayce. I quickly shot webs to keep them in place, which wasn't necessary as they were already knocked out from Jayce's fall. I slowly staggered towards them, and, touching both their shoulders, I transferred some of my powers to them, but I had no say in which of the powers would be transferred; it was random. After the transfer, my body started feeling better. Then I went back to my office in the factory. Just as I entered my office, Chross found me and said,

"Master, our spies informed us that the Noxon soldiers are on the move, and an enforcer gave Margot a letter addressed to you."

I took the letter from him and gave Chross&Margot a scrutinising gaze. (They are Definitely a couple now). Margot and Chross blushed as Margot hugged Chross's right arm. The letter read, "I (Caitlyn) will give what you want, but in return, you and all your people must cooperate with Piltover in the war against Noxus. The battle starts on the 10th." As soon as I finished reading it, I told Margot and Chross to assemble their henchmen and send them to Piltover to help the Piltovens. As they left my office, I separated from Silco's body and drank the body-stabilising potion.

Using my own body after 6 months felt very good, especially because my body stopped fragmenting with the use of the stabilising potion.

Then, I infused Silco's body with his soul. As it was noon, the battle had already started, so I quickly turned into my half-dragon form and flew towards Piltover. Just before reaching the battlefield, I heard gunshots and screaming from the top floors of the Hextech Projectile launching towers. So I secured those towers first and instructed some enforcers to man the Hextech Projectile Launchers. Following that, I started wiping the floor against the Noxus soldiers. Everywhere I went, bodies flew; some died, and some suffered incapacitating injuries. Conversely, Ambessa was busy fighting against Caitlyn and her daughter(Mel).

Caitlyn had already been injured a few days ago, so she struggled quite a bit. Ambessa noticed that her army was not making much progress; hence, she stopped playing around, broke Caitlyn's right leg, and took care of her daughter. Mel's power was useless against Ambessa as she had petricite stones. Mel was out of practice in martial arts, so she was quickly overwhelmed.

Just as Ambessa was about to land a haymaker on Mel, I stopped her punch. I said, " You picked a losing fight, Ambessa." Then we started fighting. I did not use Mana to empower my body as I did not want to overexert myself and cause more instabilities.

But I also didn't want to drag on the fight. So, I feigned taking a hit and being off-balanced. Ambessa took the bait and went for a massive uppercut. Shooting a web towards the ground, I swivelled around behind her and stabbed her using my hand(Dracula Style). Just as she was about to die, LeBlanc took her to the bloody rose dimension. Mel sees her mother getting consumed by roses and follows her into LeBlanc's dimension. From there, she rescues her mother. When she comes back with her mother, they exchange a few words before she dies. Then, the Noxus soldiers stopped fighting and pledged loyalty to Mel, like the show. As a reward for successfully killing Ambessa and restoring the show's critical moment, I unlocked 50% of my Mana. Caitlyn asked,

“ Did White Knight send you?” “No. I am White Knight." She did not believe me as my original body and Silco's body were quite different in shape. I explained to her that the previous form was of another man I possessed. "Really." " Seriously , I resurrected your mother, and you don't believe that I can possess a body." Right then, my henchmen had arrived. I instructed them to help the injured soldiers and give aid as much as possible. I also aided them.

In a back alley in the Undercity, two familiar faces woke up at the same time. One was Vi, and the other was Jayce. They were surprised to see each other"

"Jayce? What are you doing her"?" Vi asked"

"I came to find Vikto"," he replied.

Vi lost her balance and fell atop Jayce as they both attempted to get up. This caused them to find themselves in a very intimate position, making it appear to a passerby as though they were about to kiss. They locked eyes and breathed the same air, momentarily stunned. At that instant, both shared the same thought:""I want to kiss him/her so bad ."

They unconsciously activated their two newfound abilities: Charmcast and Pheromones. Additionally, they possessed Wall Crawl, Night Vision, and Mate Lock. Both Vi and Jayce had not engaged in any intimate encounters in at least four months.

So in this situation with both abilities activated they could not hold back. Vi hesitatingly leaned in and gently kissed Jayce. The kiss broke all of the inhibitions holding Jayce back. Jayce held Vi’s heVi'snd started fiercely kissing Vi. And Vi did the same. Both of them kissed so passionately that breathing felt like a hassle.

What ensued involved a lot of moaning, kissing and grunother'surprisingly, Vi Jayce'ser been with a man before. They went at it from noon till sunset.

Once they had finished repairing each other’s clothes, they realised the factory was already c"osed, which allowed them a cl"ar escapeJayce'sey were leaving, Jayce said, “Let’s me't again inWe'reek. That shoul' give us enough time to gather our thJayce'sand feelings about this Jayce's situation.”

Vi felt a pleasant warmth at his words, so much so "I'mshe ac"ivated her Mate Lock unconsciously" “Where?” she asked.

“On your side o" the bridge at 5:00?”

“See you there.”

“See you later, Violet.”

Although Vi didn't like it when others called her by that name, she liked the way Jayce said it. With that, they parted ways.

Meanwhile, our main character observed their interaction from the moment they were finishing up until their departure. He also noticed Vi activating Mate Lock.

He followed them because he needed to speak with Vi. MC caught her attention by saying, “I know where Vander is.”



( Note :-Mate Lock:- a one-time use passive ability that binds the hosother's soul to the target{Jayce} )

<P><h4>Chapter 10</h4>




Today was an eventful day. First, I visited the underground Hexgate facility to do some research. Second, I followed Jayce Tails. Third, I saved Viktor. Fourth, I rescued Viktor's villagers. Fifth, I accidentally brought two people together—Violet and Jayce. Sixth, I gave Silco a new lease on life. Seventh, I won a war for the losing side. Eighth, I killed Ambessa. Ninth, I assisted injured people. Now, I am escorting Vi to see her father. I hope he has woken up by now, and I thought as I arrived at my father-in-law's house and lab.

Vi rang the bell, and surprisingly, Vander answered the door. When Vi saw Vander, she exclaimed in disbelief, "Dad?" Vander responded, "Is that you, Vi?" and she hugged him tightly. I called out from behind, "Let's get inside first."

Meanwhile, Silco and Jinx unexpectedly crossed paths on the other side of Zaun. What a small world we live in! After Saleh Jarjis left Silco alone in his office, Silco woke up about ten minutes later. By then, the factory had been shut down under orders from the Chem-Barons, who had gathered their henchmen to prepare for war against Noxus. The henchmen armed themselves with guns from Saleh Jarjis and various useful tools and gadgets.

When Silco woke up, he found himself in an unfamiliar office. He stepped outside and noticed that the building was empty and locked. To escape, he broke a window. As he did so, Silco realised some changes in his body—he had grown about three inches taller, his skin had turned pale instead of brown, his ears had become pointy, and his body had more muscle.

After escaping, he surveyed his surroundings. His head began to hurt as he tried to remember returning to the lanes. He saw flashes of things he had done but couldn't imagine himself doing them. His only intact memories were when he worked in the mines at age twenty-two. Completely lost, he wandered the streets, trying to find Vander's tavern. The city had changed a lot since he remembered it.

As dusk settled over the lanes, Jinx finished checking them. "Well, that was a bust. Now I have to meet up with Sis at Jericho's. Ugh! How does she eat those things? Can those even be considered food?" She grimaced but decided to go anyway.

Upon reaching the food shop, Jinx looked around for Vi but didn't spot her. Instead, she noticed a familiar silhouette eating some noodles. As she placed her right hand on the person's shoulder, he turned to face her.

When Jinx saw Silco's face, she was astonished. She could hardly believe her eyes.

"Can I help you?" Silco asked.

With a stifled voice, Jinx replied, "Silco?"

Silco hesitated and said, "Yes?"

Then, without warning, Jinx jumped on him, attaching herself to Silco like a koala. Tears streamed down her face as she pleaded, "Please don't leave me. I'll be good. I'll listen from now on. Please, Dad, don't go."

When Silco heard her say "Dad," everything clicked into place. He recognised her and said, "Powder?"

While they talked, Silco comforted Jinx.

A passing factory worker witnessed this interaction and quickly reported it to his supervisor (Singed).

<P><h4>Chapter 11</h4>




I invited Vi inside and entertained the father-daughter pair. Vander was thrilled to see his daughter after such a long time. They talked happily about various topics. Vander shared how the doctor, Singed, had found him and kept him alive through multiple experiments on his body.

After that, I headed to the lab to find the doctor. When I arrived, I saw him speaking with a worker. Upon noticing me, the doctor dismissed the worker.

“Good evening, doctor. Do you have any good news for me?” I asked.

“It’s just rumours and gossip. Who are you?” he(the doctor) replied.

“You wound me, doctor. I am your son-in-law.”

“Jarjis?”

“In the flesh."

“This is your true form?”

“Yes. What did that worker say?”

"He mentioned seeing Silco and Jinx talking by Jerico's."

Upon hearing that, I remembered leaving Silco in my office. I quickly went outside, beckoned to the worker, and instructed him to find Jinx, tell her that Vi had found Vander, and guide her to the doctor’s lab.

Then, I sneaked into Orianna's room. When I entered, she noticed me and said, "Where were you all day? You didn't call me even once!" (Note: MC had given a few of his trusted individuals walkie-talkies, and Orianna immediately recognised MC because of their blood-bound marriage.)

Feeling guilty, I sheepishly replied, "Sorry, I had much to do today."

“And why did you get shorter?” she asked.

“Take a seat, my dear. The explanation will take a while,” I said.

I proceeded to tell her the gist of everything I had done. As I recounted my adventures, Orianna's face displayed a range of emotions.

She then asked, "Now, can I see your face?"

I boasted, “Prepare yourself, lady; you are about to see the most handsome man in Runeterra.”

Upon seeing his face Orianna replied, “Average.”

Meanwhile, downstairs, the bell rang again. The informant factory worker had come before, bringing Jinx and Silco.

The doctor was about to open the door, but Vi stopped him, saying, “Doc, let me get that.” When she opened the door, the first thing she noticed was Jinx pointing a gun at the worker. Jinx exclaimed, “Hurray! You get to keep your head intact; now leave!” Just as the worker was about to run for his life, I called out to him from the stairs, telling him to stop. I approached the worker and handed him 10 golden Hex coins. “For your troubles,” I said. The worker profusely thanked me and left as fast as he could.

I looked at Jinx condescendingly and said, “Learn some manners; you aren’t a child anymore.” I then led them to the diner for some dinner. Silco was the first to notice Vander in the dining room and inquired, "Oh no! What happened to you, Vander?" Vander replied, "I could ask you the same thing, Silco. I remember you being shorter than me."

After they all sat down, Vi asked me, "Why are they (Vander and Silco) talking like old friends?" I explained that the processes I had used to fix Vander and Silco caused them to lose memory.

After dinner, I gave them the key to the apartment complex I bought a while ago.

<P><h4>Chapter 12</h4>




After yesterday's busy day, I wanted to take a break, but now was not the time for rest. I still had many things to do.

First thing in the morning, after having breakfast, I told Orianna that I would be busy for the next few days.

Then I told Chross to find me two fresh corpses—one man, the other a woman. I also gave him specific details about their bodies.

Chross was able to acquire the bodies of some dead Noxian soldiers that washed up on the riverbed in Zaun. Their bodies were heavily injured, so I had to patch them up. After that, I infused their bodies with the souls of Viktor and Sky. I also injected some Ki into them to ensure they woke up quickly.

Sky was the first to wake, followed by Viktor a few minutes later. Those few minutes were very worrying for Sky.

As soon as Viktor woke up, Sky hugged him. I decided to give them some privacy and excused myself from my office. Just as I stepped outside, Margot approached me and said, "Master, there is a Dhampir boy with Councilor Tails in the reception room."

(Note: The main character chose a boy from Viktor's village to keep him informed about village affairs and instructed the boy to come to him for any significant matters.)

“So Jayce went back to check for a corpse and got caught,” I deduced. I went downstairs to meet them. I saw the boy sitting on a chair, and Jayce was tightly bound with rope.

The boy said, “Sir, I saw him snooping around in the village, so I brought him here.” I handed the boy twenty golden hex coins and replied, “Good job.” The boy then asked, “Sir, have we met before?”

I released my magic aura, and the boy recognised me immediately. He stood up straight and said, "Master, I'm sorry. Please forgive me for not recognising you."

I assured the boy not to worry and asked him to leave Jayce with me. After he left, bowing repeatedly, I took Jayce's rune stone, which he had received from Viktor in the post-apocalyptic world. I hypnotised Jayce to forget the last five minutes.

Once he was unbound, I instructed Chross to take him back to Piltover. Afterwards, I focused on various paperwork regarding Zaun’s rights and benefits. I also hired Silco and Vander to help sort through the documents.

Three days later, on the 14th of the 6th month, I, along with Vander and the Chem-Barons, attended a council meeting atop the Piltover-Zaun bridge. Other familiar figures were also present, including Vi, Singed, Mrs Kiramman, Sevika, Councilor Shoola, Jayce, and Professor Heimerdinger.

The meeting didn't last long, as Zaun's demands were overdue. Even if there were complaints, no one dared to voice them aloud because, without Zaun’s help, there would be no Piltover today.

Toward the end of the meeting, Caitlyn asked me, “Mr. Saleh, would you please take my place as commander?” I replied, “No, that's too much of a hassle. But I will take the reins if needed.”

Then, Councilor Shoola suggested, "How about we declare ourselves a twin-city kingdom and make you our honorary king?" I asked in turn, "Will I have to do paperwork?" Jinx couldn't hide her laughter in the background, revealing her enforcer disguise. Hearing her laugh, I said, "I, Saleh Jarjis, with the authority bestowed upon me, hereby sentence Jinx to three months of jail time and two years of social service."

After the meeting, I asked Jayce, "Where is your girlfriend?" He replied, "If you're talking about Mel, then 'no.' She left with the Noxus army." I continued, "So you are single now?" Jayce looked at Vi and said, "Not necessarily."

I leaned in and whispered, “Don’t screw this one up. I’ll be rooting for both of you.”

<P><h4>Chapter 13</h4>




After the founding of Initia Nova, the people of both cities were sceptical yet hopeful about their future. However, they were primarily preoccupied with discussing the spectacle in the sky from the previous day, particularly the fire-breathing dragon that had appeared.

The next evening, after finishing my teaching duties at the college, I hired workers to set up the wind generators and power stations. Shortly after, I received news from an informant about the discovery of a type of black oil in an old factory area.

I was very excited by this news; it meant I no longer had to worry about future power shortages. Noticing my excitement, the informant asked, “Sir, do you know what this black oil is?” I handed him 10 hex coins and replied, “This is not just any oil; it’s black gold.”

I told the system to gauge the amount of oil beneath the surface. The system replied, “Approximately 200,000,000 barrels worth.” That number dumbfounded me. I said, “Caitlyn, I am going to make you the richest lady in the world.”

I then went to the site and asked the locals, “Who owns this plot of land?” They informed me that it belonged to the Kirammans.

Then I went to find Silco. I wanted to tell him to go to the Kirammans to inform them about black oil( crude oil). Silco’s office door was half open. As I was about to open it fully, I saw a scene I was not meant to see.

Inside, Silco and Sevika were heavily making out. I quickly shut the door and said, “Shut the door before starting, DAMN IT!”

In my furious state, I went to find Chross to send him instead of Silco. As I opened Chross's office door, I saw him and Margot getting nasty. So, I immediately apologised and left. Then I went to Vander’s tavern. Technically, it was mine; I employed Vander to run it as an undercover base for my spies. When I entered the tavern, I saw Vi behind the bar and Jinx serving drinks to the customers. I approached Vi and asked, “Where is Vander?”

“He went upstairs with Lest to go over some paperwork,” she replied.

“Lest?” I inquired.

“You know, the Vastaya you saved during the war and hired as a spy,” she explained.

“Hmm, I remember something like that. Anyway, why do you look so giddy? Did Jayce ask you out or something?”

Vi panicked and whispered, “How did you know?”

I replied, “It doesn’t matter. Just remember to invite me to the wedding, and I want to name your firstborn!”

Then I went upstairs to find Vander. When I reached the apex of the stairs, I saw Lest and Vander doing something nasty. So, I stopped bothering others and went to Kiramman’s estate myself.

After arriving at the estate, I decided to skip the doors and hallways since I seemed to have bad luck with them that day. Instead, I jumped up to Caitlyn’s window and knocked on it. When Caitlyn opened the window, she said, “I do have a window, you know.” I replied, “I know, but today has not been a good day for doors and hallways.”

“Bad luck?” she asked.

“Yes, today I got flashed by three couples.” I paused momentarily before continuing, “Anyway, I came to share some great news.”

Caitlyn looked intrigued. “I’m listening,” she said.

Then I proudly declared, “I, Saleh Jarjis, will make you the richest woman in the world.”

She responded, “Sorry, I’m not into guys.”

I smirked and replied, “I’m already married.”

Afterwards, I told her about the crude oil reserve and how to utilise that natural resource. Caitlyn's eyes lit up with excitement when she heard about crude oil's potential.

Caitlyn took out a wine bottle to celebrate the occasion. Then she offered me a glass.

I declined and said, “ I don’t drink alcohol.”

“ You have to drink something! How about some tea?” I replied, “I like tea, but Zaun doesn’t have good tea.” She said, “ Well, you're in luck, as my mother has great taste in tea.”

After that, Caitlyn and I went downstairs to the kitchen for some tea. But seeing the closed kitchen doors, I had a bad feeling.

Caitlyn said, “Strange, who would close the kitchen doors at this hour?” I told Caitlyn to Knock first.

But she scoffed and said, “ This is my house; no one would dare do it here.” As Caitlyn dramatically opened the kitchen doors, she and I witnessed Mr & Mrs Kiramman’s most scandalous scene.

I gave Caitlyn a bombastic side eye and said, “ I told you.”

<P><h4>Afterwards</h4>




Saleh Jarjis continued to help Initia Nova prosper and expand its technological advancements. He ventured to different parts of Runeterra to collect various runes and recruit champions such as Kai’Sa, Kassadin, Twisted Fate, Greaves, Nunu & Willump, Riven, Seraphine, and Smolder.

In Shurima, he established a strong diplomatic relationship by aiding Azir in becoming an ascended warrior and bringing Sivir to his tomb. He fought against dragons and gained their cooperation to combat the Void. In his quest for peace, he defeated Mordekaiser and others like him, who threatened chaos to the world.

During his time in Demacia, he befriended Poppy, the brave Yordle warrior, by proving himself a true hero and helping her realize her long-standing misunderstanding. He also seized the opportunity to save Jarvan III and persuaded him to grant the mistreated mages their rights.

When Saleh travelled to Freljord, he was severely injured due to the wrath of some cosmic watchers. To provide his host with a vial of phoenix tears, he was assigned a mission to defeat Sejuani, making her his second blood-bound bride, which made his married life increasingly complicated.

Before all these adventures, Saleh embarked on his first journey outside Initia Nova to find Prof. Heimerdinger. He found him in Camavor. Following that, he visited Bandle City with Professor Heimerdinger. There, he made many Yordle friends, and Tristina and Lulu followed him back to Zaun, thinking that being with him would lead to exciting adventures. Their expectations were fulfilled as they spent the two decades embarking on countless thrilling experiences together.
